# Data

A brief description of each data source is provided below (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}). The following sources of data were used in building this assessment, and the data preparation approach was unchanged from the 2019 benchmark, with the exception of implementing the latest version of the PacFinUtilities R package (version 0.0.2.0002), and including the commercial discard lengths.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fishery-independent data, including relative abundance indices and length and age data from the 
Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) Survey `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 8,'Yr'])`-`r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 8,'Yr'])`, and relative abundance indices and age data from the NWFSC slope survey `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 7,'Yr'])`-`r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 7,'Yr'])`, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Slope Survey `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 6,'Yr'])`-`r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 6,'Yr'])`, and the Triennial Shelf Survey `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 5,'Yr'])`-`r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 5,'Yr'])`. Input sample sizes were based on the number of tows for length and marginal age compositions, whereas conditional age-at-length (CAAL) input sample sizes were based on the number of fish sampled. 
\item Estimates of fecundity, maturity, weight-length relationships, and ageing imprecision. There were no changes to the input growth, fecundity, or natural mortality values from the 2019 benchmark assessment.
\item Informative sex-specific priors on natural mortality based upon meta-analytical 
relationships with other life-history parameters derived from data across a number of fish stocks 
(Figure \ref{fig:naturalmortalityprior}). This update assessment used the same prior as was implemented in the 2019 benchmark assessment.
\item Reported commercial and reconstructed landings 1889-`r model$endyr` (Figures \ref{fig:removals} and \ref{fig:catch_comparison}).
\item Biological data (ages) from the commercial port sampling programs 1983-`r model$endyr`. Input sample sizes for the composition data were based on the number of port samples.
\item Estimates of commercial discard length and mean weight and fraction discarded in the fishery obtained from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP; 2002-2019 and 1986-1988 from Pikitch, Erickson, and Wallace (1988). Input sample sizes for discard length compositions were based on the number of observed trips. 
\item Environmental index of age-0 recruitment derived from tide-gauge measurements of sea level, for which we re-ran the analysis using tide guage data through 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:ssh-plot}).
\end{enumerate}
## Fishery-Independent data

### Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey{#nwcbo}

The WCGBT Survey has maintained a consistent stratified random-grid survey design over the period `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 8,'Yr'])`-`r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 8,'Yr'])`, including depths from 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. WCGBT data are used to estimate a relative index of abundance for several groundfish species including `r spp`, which are captured in a high proportion of survey hauls over most of the west coast shelf and slope depths.
The survey design divides the U.S. West Coast into $\sim$ 13,000 adjacent cells of equal area. Typically, four chartered industry vessels conduct tows in randomly selected grid cells as they travel from north to south during one of two passes from late-May to mid-October. The design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability and variability associated with selecting a relatively small number ($\sim$ 700) of cells from the large population of possible cells. Note that the WCGBT Survey is not permitted to access the Cowcod Conservation areas in southern California. Additionally, there were only two vessels used in 2019 and three in 2013, with one of the three that year unable to complete its survey pass due to government shutdown. No survey occurred in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
 

The data were analyzed using the Vector-Autoregressive spatiotemporal Model (VAST; @thorson_comparing_2017, @thorson_guidance_2019) available within the
[https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST](VAST) R package following the same procedure as was done in 2019 (Figure \ref{fig:WCGBTindexcompare}). 
\begin{comment}
VAST allows for the estimation of the variation in density for multiple locations across time and categories (e.g., species or age classes) and has been reviewed, endorsed, and recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee for estimating abundance indices. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation is specifically included in both model components, i.e., encounter probabilities and positive catch rates, which are modeled using logit- and log-links, respectively. Gamma and log-normal error structures were investigated for the positive catch-rate component of the model to allow for skewness in the estimated distribution [@maunder2004fishresadjusting]. Vessel-year effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year to account for the random selection of commercial vessels from those that were available [@helser_generalized_2004, @thorson_accounting_2014]. In summary, the survey biomass density (weight per area swept) was a function of year, latitude, longitude, and vessel-year. Spatial variation was approximated using 500 knots and the results were corrected for transformation bias @thorson_implementing_2016 using an algorithm in Template Model Builder @kristensen_tmb_2016. Further details regarding the structure of the spatiotemporal model available in VAST are available in the [https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/tree/master/vignettes](user manual).
Specific details of how VAST was configured to estimate an index of abundance from WCGBT Survey data are available at[https://github.com /nwfsc-assess/VASTWestCoast](VASTWestCoast), which contains scripts specific to fitting VAST to data from surveys operating off of the U.S. West Coast. For example, a covariate was included for survey pass (i.e., 'first' or 'second') to account for the incomplete sampling during the second pass of the 2013 WCGBT Survey when the survey was cut short and no stations south of $37^\circ$N were sampled (Figure \ref{databyyearWCGBT3}) or seasonal, latitudinal movement.
\end{comment}
VAST Model convergence and fit were evaluated using the matrix of second-order partial derivatives ('Hessian matrix') and quantile-quantile ('Q-Q') plots of the predicted distribution versus the expectation under a null model (i.e., uniform distribution). Positive definite Hessian matrices were indicative of a model that had reached a local minimum and, thus, converged. Q-Q plots that largely followed a 1:1 relationship suggested that the distributional form used to fit the positive catch-rate data captured the shape of the dispersion present in the data (Figure \ref{fig:WCGBTQQ}). Histograms of the quantiles were also used to inspect for over- and under-estimated probability of encounter rates, which can suggest a lack of fit. Finally, plots of Pearson residuals across space and time were investigated for spatial and spatiotemporal patterns suggesting model misspecification. Additional tables and a comparison with the design based index are available in Appendix 1 of the 2019 benchmark assessment [@Haltuch2019b].

The estimated index shows relatively precise indices with a strong declining trend from 2004-2008, stabilization with a slight increase from 2008 through 2016, an increase between 2016 and 2017 and finally a flat trend through 2019 (Figure \ref{fig:WCGBTindexest}). The increase in the mid-2010s is largely due to increases in densities off of the coast of Washington. We utilized a gamma distribution, as Q-Q plots in the 2019 benchmark suggested that the gamma distribution fit the data better than a log-normal distribution (see @Haltuch2019b). The lowest densities per year were predicted off of the southern coast of California (Figure \ref{fig:surveydensWCGBT1}). No spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals (Figure \ref{fig:surveyresid1WCGBT1}).
```{r, show = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
getcohortsWCGBTS <- unique(model$lendbase[model$lendbase$Fleet == 8 & model$lendbase$Bin < 28&model$lendbase$Obs > quantile(model$lendbase[model$lendbase$Bin < 28, c("Obs")], probs = 0.90), "Yr"])
getcohortsWCGBTS[length(getcohortsWCGBTS)] <- paste(
	"and", tail(getcohortsWCGBTS, 1))
getcohortsWCGBTS<- paste(getcohortsWCGBTS, collapse = ", ")
```
Sampled lengths were binned into `r length(unique(model$lendbase$Bin))` 2cm-wide bins from  `r min(model$lendbase$Bin)` (cm) to $\geq$ `r max(model$lendbase$Bin)` (cm) to summarize the sex- and year-specific length data. 
\begin{comment} Unsexed fish were assigned to males and females using a 50:50 ratio. `r spp` were well sampled (Table \ref{surveycompn}), and the data broadly show modes for age-0 fish `r min(model$lendbase$Bin)-min(model$lendbase$Bin)+10` cm), age-1 fish ` r min(model$lendbase$Bin)+10-min(model$lendbase$Bin)+20` cm, and adults to $\sim$` r max(model$lendbase$Bin)-10` cm (Figure \ref{lcaggregate}).\end{comment} 
Large cohorts are visible beginning in 2008, 2010 and 2013 showing clear progressions in the length-composition data over time (Figure \ref{fig:torcfleet8lencomps}).
\begin{comment} Age structures are generally collected from a subset of the fish that have been measured for length. Thus, it is common to include these data as conditional age-at-length (CAAL) compositions. Summarizing the data in this way consists of tabulating the ages within a given length category, where marginal compositions perform the additional step of summing age tabulations across all lengths. Thus, CAAL compositions treat the distribution of ages for each length category as separate observations, conditioned on the lengths from which they came. When a data set is representative of the population, utilizing CAAL data can be beneficial. However, recent research has called into question using CAAL data when they are not representative of the population because it can lead to bias and imprecise estimates of the population age structure and derived model quantities @lee2019fishresone}. When CAAL are representative of the population, three benefits may be realized by using CAAL compositions compared to using standard marginal age compositions. 
First, including CAAL data in the model-fitting process incorporates uncertainty due to sampling and missing data, whereas externally created age-length keys are often input without error.
Second, CAAL data tabulated for each length bin removes the problem of double counting information on sex ratios and year-class strengths such as when marginal age-compositions are used along with length compositions and the same fish are contributing to two likelihood components, which are assumed to be independent. CAAL compositions thus allow only additional information provided by the age data (relative to the generally far more numerous length observations) to be captured.
Third, CAAL observations facilitate internal estimation of basic growth parameters (length at age and $K$) and distribution of lengths at a given age, usually governed by two parameters, the coefficient of variation of length at a specified young age and the coefficient of variation of length at a much older age. Without CAAL data, coefficient of variation's can only be derived from accurately aged and measured marginal age- and length-composition observations where strong and well-separated cohorts exist. Estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model facilitates the inclusion of this major source of uncertainty in the assessment results. \end{comment} 
Conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data from the WCGBT Survey are used in the base model because this survey is the most representative source of `r spp` age and length data from the U.S. West Coast. 
Age distributions included `r length(unique(model$agedbase$Bin))` bins from age `r min(model$agedbase$Bin)` to age `r max(model$agedbase$Bin)` and older. Approximately one-quarter as many fish were aged as were measured for length, but these fish were collected from a similar number of tows. CAAL compositions confirm cohorts seen in the length compositions, although signals are dominated largely by age-1 fish (Figures \ref{fig:acomp_resid_caal1}-\ref{fig:acomp_resid_caal4}). An appreciable number of fish are also observed in age classes above age 10. Data confirm the the rapid growth trajectory over the first several years of life, with growth slowing rapidly after 10 years old. Dimorphic growth is also pronounced, with virtually all `r spp` above 70 cm being female (Figure \ref{fig:bio_53}).

### Northwest Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey


The NWFSC Slope survey preceded the WCGBT Survey, starting in `r min(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 7, "Yr"])` and ending in `r max(model$cpue[model$cpue$Fleet == 7, "Yr"])`.\begin{comment} However, the southern and shallow areas were not sampled during this survey as they are in the WCGBT Survey.\end{comment} The survey covered depths ranging from 183 - 1,280 m and used small (i.e. 65-86 foot) chartered commercial fishing vessels. This survey consists of fewer tows than the WCGBT Survey and the fraction of tows that sampled ages is much lower. VAST was used in a similar fashion to that specified for fitting the WCGBT Survey data to estimate
a relative index of abundance for the 2019 benchmark assessment, which we did not change for this update. We also did not change the biological data associated with this historical survey.
\begin{comment} No random component for vessel-year
was included for this survey. The estimated index shows a relatively flat trajectory over the survey
period except for the increase in 2000 (Figure 27). Q-Q plots suggested that the gamma distribution
(Figures 28 and C.7) fit the data, better than a log-normal distribution (results not shown). No
spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals (Figures 29-34).
The length-compositions for the NWFSC Slope Survey showed the 1999 cohort as age-1, -2, and
-3, but did not observe them at age-0 (Figure 35); this is expected because generally age-0 fish
are present only over shallower depths. Dimorphic growth is visible in the data. The marginal
age distributions corroborate the strong 1999 year-class and show some evidence for a strong 1995
cohort, as well as a protracted distribution of ages above age 10 (Figure 36). \end{comment}

### Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are considered complete surveys are included in assessments. Limited sampling in earlier years covered only relatively small and inconsistent portions of the coast and are therefore insufficient to provide an index of abundance. This survey had a very high degree of both positive tows and biological sampling. A relative index of abundance was estimated using VAST for the 2019 benchmark assessment; it was unchanged in this update.  We also did not change the biological data associated with this historical survey.

### Triennial Shelf Survey

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.
Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years. Values for this survey remained unchanged from the 2019 benchmark for this update.  We also did not change the biological data associated with this historical survey.

### Other fishery-independent data

Pot surveys were conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989 in northern International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC) areas (U.S. Vancouver and Columbia) and in 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1991 in southern (Eureka, Monterey, and Conception) INPFC areas (@parks1981, @parks1983, @parks1985, @parks1987, @parks1989, @kimura1985). The number of fish per pot and biological data were collected according to the following grade-specific categories: large (\textgreater68 cm); medium (62-67 cm); small (52-61 cm); and extra-small (51 cm) fish. Early `r spp` stock assessments had little choice but to use the geographically limited and variable pot surveys as indices of abundance. Over time, growing time-series of trawl-survey indices, conflicting abundance trends, and incomplete spatial coverage within the pot surveys have led to their exclusion from all recent stock assessments. These indices have not been revisited for this assessment, but future work could re-evaluate the possibility that there is some useful information in these data through updated analysis or modeling methods.

### Environmental indices{#ssh}
Research and assessments during recent decades have examined the relationship between sea level, measured via tide gauges, and `r spp` recruitment (@schirripa2001sablefish, @schirripa2005sablefish, @schirripa2006, @schirripa2007sablefish, @schirripa2009icesjms, @stewart2011sablefish, @johnson2016sablefish). Changes in sea level serve as a proxy for large-scale climate forcing that drives regional changes in alongshore and cross-shelf ocean transport. A re-analysis of the sea level-recruitment relationship was conducted for this assessment that included all available tide-gauge data available for the U.S. West Coast through 2020, using the same approach as in the 2019 benchmark assessment. The resultant values are nearly identical to those used in that assessment (Figure \ref{fig:ssh-plot} and Table \ref{tab:ssh-input}).

\begin{comment}
 These changes directly impact the transport of water masses, nutrients, and organisms @schirripa2006, @dilorenzo2013. The sea-level index evaluated within the stock assessment modeling context consisted of a spatiotemporal (April, May, and June) average using data from 4 tide-gauge stations in the northern California Current. Earlier assessments tested a number of covariates at several temporal and regional aggregations, resulting in a total of almost 900 unique possible combinations @stewart2011sablefish. Not all of these time series were independent. Additionally, the previous selection of sea level was, in part, to replace the copepod index on the basis of the correlation between the two indices, with sea level providing a more complete time series @stewart2011sablefish. Copepods are an important food source for larvae and juveniles @grover1987, @mcfarlane1990. The 2011 assessment @stewart2011sablefish suggested that there is little chance of selecting a randomly generated time-series with the observed $R^2$ between recruitment and sea level, supporting the hypothesis that the relationship between `r spp` recruitment and sea level is not spurious. However, repeated testing of these types of relationships remains necessary.

While biologically meaningful, the sea level-recruitment relationship is weak ($\sim R^2=0.35$ from the Schirripa studies), and use of the index in recent years has not had a large effect on assessments because much of the variation in recruitment is already captured in the age-structure data @stewart2011sablefish}. Additionally, previous analyses have selected tide-gauge locations based on the strength of the resulting relationship with recruitment, potentially biasing the results @schirripa2007sablefish, johnson2016sablefish. ROMS models have had some success explaining of `r spp` recruitment @tolimieri2018, but the available time-series cover a limited period (1980-2010). While the ROMS models can be updated, limited environmental-forcing data means that the models cannot necessarily be projected back in time with much confidence. Thus the ROMS-based indicators cannot be used to hindcast recruitment to better incorporate recruitment dynamics for early periods.

A re-analysis of the sea level-recruitment relationship was conducted for this assessment that included all tide-gauge data available for the U.S. West Coast (see Appendix \ref{app:env} for full details including model selection, validation, and testing). The goals of this analysis were to 
1. re-examine the sea level-recruitment relationship to develop a stronger predictive relationship, 
2. produce a more statistically justifiable sea-level index, and 
3. extend the time span of any environmental sea-level index to allow for both hindcasting and forecasting of `r spp` recruitment. Even a weakly correlated index might allow for qualitative forecasting, while hindcasting recruitment would better describe recruitment dynamics in early model periods when size and age data were not available to inform the assessment.
The re-analysis had two steps.  
First, dynamic factor analysis (DFA; @zuur2003environmetrics, zuur2003cjfas}) was used to find common trends in mean second quarter sea level at sixteen stations spanning Neah Bay to San Diego along the U.S. West Coast (Figure \ref{app:env}33).
Second, model selection was then used to find the combination of dynamic factors that best explained residuals around the stock-recruitment relationship from the 2015 assessment (Johnson et al. 2016). This approach describes coast-wide sea level and avoids \emph{a priori} selection of locations.
The best DFA model had five dynamic factors (Figure \ref{app:env}37). The time series available at each tide-gauge location varied (Figure \ref{app:env}34), but DFA can combine time series with missing data and of unequal length. The resulting dynamic factors span \textcolor{red} {1925-2018 (second quarter data for 2019 were not available the time of this analysis)}. The first dynamic factor was positively correlated with sea level with the strongest correlations north of Cape Mendocino (Figure \ref{app:env}35). The second dynamic factor was negatively correlated with sea level, most strongly at central stations. The third dynamic factor was negatively correlated with sea level with the strongest correlations south of Cape Mendocino and especially south of Monterey Bay. The remaining factors showed no particular pattern.
The best-fit linear model (Table \ref{app:env}2), which explained 35\% of the variation in recruitment around the stock-recruit curve (Figure \ref{ecocons4}), was 
$$
Stock-recruitment~residuals \sim DF1 + DF3 + DF3^2,
$$
where $DF1$ and $DF3$ are the first and third dynamic factors (Figure \ref{app:env}35). The DF1 alone, explained 25\% of the variation in recruitment around the stock-recruit curve, and was evaluated within the stock assessment model as DF1 is most similar to what has been used in previous stock assessments. This analysis included the years 1975--2015 because of a paucity of size and age data prior to 1975 and because assessment-based biomass and recruitment estimates were available through 2015 @johnson2016sablefish}. `r spp` recruitment was negatively correlated with sea level north of Cape Mendocino ($DF1$), while the relationship was somewhat more complex in the south ($DF3$) due to the inclusion the quadratic term for $DF3$.
\textcolor{red}{Comparison of predicted recruitment residuals from the best-fit model with those from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 assessment show a good overall fit (Figure \ref{app:env}36). However, the relationship was weak ($R^2$ = 0.35), largely because the model failed to predict lower than expected recruitments in 2005, 2006, and 2009 and underestimated the strength of the higher than predicted recruitments in 1976, 1979, 1999, and 2013. Nevertheless, the model did predict peaks in the recruitment residuals in these four years. Thus, the relationship functions as a conservative indicator of `r spp` recruitment success.

The years 2016-2018 extend beyond the recruitment and biomass estimates in the last `r spp` stock assessment, so we cannot compare them directly to assessment estimates. However, they can be compared to estimates of `r spp` recruitment from the WCGBT Survey (Figure \ref{app:env}7). The index predicted higher than expected (based on the stock-recruitment relationship) recruitment for 2016, which is corroborated by a peak in the abundance of age-0 `r spp` in the trawl survey in this year. However, while the index also suggests higher than expected recruitment in 2018, this prediction is not observed in the trawl data. Good recruitment for `r spp` appears related, in part, to cooler temperatures during the female pre-conditioning period prior to spawning @tolimieri2018}. The 2018 year class follows several years of a marine heat wave (i.e., `the blob'), which may have reduced female condition and resulted in lower realized recruitment than that expected by the sea-level index.}
Comparing the distribution of age-0 recruits (Figure \ref{app:env}7) to the model performance (Figure \ref{app:env}39) suggests that strong over predictions (more than 1.0 standard deviation above the assessment derived stock recruitment residual) may be due to failure to account for processes in the south in some way, regardless of the fact that $DF3$ does account for sea level south of Cape Mendocino. For example, the model over predicted recruitment in 2005-2007, 2009, and 2011.  All of these years, with the exception of 2011, saw lower recruitment in the area around San Francisco Bay. For 2011, the model predicted recruitment fairly close to that expected by the stock-recruitment relationship, and actual age-0 abundance was somewhat lower. Conversely, the model predictions were underestimates of the recruitment peaks in 2010 and 2013 when there were strong recruitments around San Francisco Bay and Point Conception.

Appendix \ref{app:env} provides a more comprehensive analysis of the sea-level index.
The sea level-recruitment relationship has been modeled both via the internal population dynamics as a direct offset to the expected value for recruitment @maunder2003, @schirripa2005sablefish and as a survey index of age-0 recruitment deviations @schirripa2007sablefish, @stewart2011sablefish, @johnson2016sablefish. The former method makes it difficult to determine the appropriate degree of recruitment variability for the deviations themselves and also requires that the environmental series be treated as if it is known without error. The latter method allows for observation error in the environmental series.
The topic of model-selection, robustness, and validation for the sea level-recruitment relationship was a recurrent theme in STAR panels and with the Pacific Fisheries Management Council Science and Statistical Committee between 2002 and 2007. Prior to 2011, the use of the sea-level index was contentious. During 2011, the sea-level data were used as a survey index of recruitment in a sensitivity using the data from 1970 forward, although the sea-level data begin during 1925. Using only the data from 1970 forward did not influence model results because the information in the length- and age-composition data largely agreed with the information in the sea-level data @stewart2011sablefish, johnson2016sablefish}. This assessment uses the DF1 and associated uncertainty, spanning 1925 through 2018, from the analysis above as a survey index of age-0 recruitment. Using the sea level time series prior to 1970, rather than limiting the data to the period in which length- and age-composition data inform recruitment strength as was done in during 2011, provides the opportunity to allow for both hindcasting recruitment and nowcasting of recruitment in the absence of survey data during the current assessment year, or in future 'catch only'assessments conducted for management. Both hindcasting during historically data poor periods and nowcasting in the absence of current survey data may better represent stock dynamics.

## Fishery-Dependent data
### Historical commercial landings
Historical commercial landings remained unchanged from the 2019 Benchmark Assessment. Landings data were extracted for the period 1982-2020 and are generally the same as those used in the benchmark assessment, with the addition of the last two years of data. (Figure \ref{fig:catch_comparison}).

### Fishery biological data

Data for all states were extracted from PacFIN's Biological Data System (BDS). Broadly, the weighting of commercial biological samples was conducted via the following method using the R package PacFIN.Utilities `https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/PacFIN.Utilities`. This approach did not change between the 2019 benchmark assessment and the present update.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Expand the sample weight of lengths (or ages) from the state recorded subsample, consisting of one or more baskets of fish, to the estimated total catch in that market category (or trip for ungraded samples). This step accounts for differences in the fraction of each landing (or market category) that was actually sampled and is important during periods where there are some differences in the number of baskets or fish that comprise a `sample'. When sample weights were unavailable, as is always the case for fish landed in Washington, gender-specific weight-length relationships were used to approximate the weight of the sample. 
\item Sum the trip-expanded values within gear and state combinations. Data sampled from larger landings thus account for more weight in the sum to better reflect the total catch.
\item Expand the values to the reconstructed gear-specific landings, ensuring that if one state sampled landings very heavily but is responsible for only a small fraction of the total landings it will not be weighted too heavily.
\item Sum the number of port-side samples included in the compositions by year and gear for the input sample size.
\end{enumerate}

### Discard ratio estimates

The WCGOP estimates commercial fishery discard ratios for the period between 2002 to 2019 using data collected by gear type, fishery (e.g., open access, limited entry), and species/management units. The discard ratios were computed as the total estimated discarded weight (lbs) on observed trips divided by the estimated total catch (discarded and retained). To aggregate these ratios into the gear types modeled in this assessment, each state, fishery, and gear combination was weighted by the total estimated catch (discarded and retained weight). Thus, the discard rates represent weighted estimates from each contributing segment within each gear type. Uncertainty in these values was quantified via bootstrapping the individual observations and then aggregating to the total estimate, providing a distribution of the discard rate. From this distribution, a standard error associated with year specific discard ratio estimate was also estimated. Note that these methods are different than those used by WCGOP to estimate total discards but explicitly consider differences in catch by sector, state, and gear.

Additional years of data were available for the trawl fleet from the 'Pikitch study' conducted from 1985-1987 @pikitch1988usdoc and the Enhanced Data Collection Program (EDCP; @sampson2002) conducted from 1996-2000. Discard rates and their corresponding standard errors for 1986-1988 were taken from a re-analysis completed by the NWFSC during 2017 (pers comm., John Wallace).
Discard rates ranged from `r paste(with(subset(model$discard,Fleet == 1),round(range(Obs),2)),collapse = '-')` for the fixed gear fishery over the period `r min(model$discard$Yr[model$discard$Fleet == 1])`-`r max(model$discard$Yr[model$discard$Fleet == 1])` (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fit}). The early estimates of discard rates for the trawl fishery from the 1980s averaged `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr < 1990 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)`. More recent trawl estimates peaked in 2002 at `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr == 2002 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)`. After the implementation of the catch share program in 2011, discard rate estimates for the trawl fleet have dropped as low as `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr == 2012 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)` in 2012, with the highest recent observed rate of `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr == 2019 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)` in `r model$discard[model$discard$Yr > 2010,][which.max(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr > 2010]),]$Yr`. There was a near quadrupling of discard rates in the trawl fishery between 2018 and 2019, from `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr == 2018 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)`\% to `r round(mean(model$discard$Obs[model$discard$Yr == 2019 & model$discard$Fleet == 3]) * 100,2)`\% (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fit}). 

### Discard mortality estimates

Discard mortality rates have been the subject of numerous research studies. `r spp`, lacking a swim-bladder (and therefore the propensity for severe barotrauma), may survive after capture, depending on the specific conditions that they experience during the process. Warmer water results in higher mortality because the physiological stress of transitioning from very cold bottom temperatures to warmer surface water and air temperatures can be great [@davis2001]. Furthermore, fixed gears are less physically damaging to `r spp` compared to spending an extended period in a trawl cod-end with a large catch volume. Treatment and handling of captured fish, including time-on-deck, are also likely to be important for subsequent survival.
Analysis of discard mortality is hampered by the lack of available temperature information. Substantial efforts as part of the 2005 assessment resulted in a detailed model-based approach that used seasonal average water temperatures to predict variable annual discard mortality rates over the historical time-series, corrected for estimated differences among gear types [@schirripa2005sablefish]. Ultimately the approach was too complex to be supported by the available data with which to assign temperature and other individual fishing trip variables.
In 2011, discard mortality estimates were corrected to be consistent with those used by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council's Groundfish Management Team (GMT) in predicting in-season total mortality and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's annual calculation of total mortality for comparison with harvest regulations. These values are 20\% discard mortality for `r spp` captured with fixed gear and 50\% discard mortality for `r spp` captured with trawls. An exception to this is for age-0 fish for which discard mortality is assumed to be 100\%. These rates were used in this assessment.

## Biological Parameters

A number of biological parameters were estimated outside the 2019 assessment model (weight-length relationship, the maturity schedule, and fecundity relationships). These values are treated as fixed in that model and the present update (Table \ref{tab:basepars}), and therefore, uncertainty reported for the stock assessment results does not include any uncertainty associated with these quantities.
