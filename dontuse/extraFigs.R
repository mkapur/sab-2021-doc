![Spatial distribution (gm  ha$^{-1}$) and time series of abundance (mt) for age-0 sablefish recruits from 2003-2018 along the U.S. West Coast. Data are from the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey for 2003-2019 and were analyzed via vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal modeling to quantify spatial and temporal patterns in the `r spp` biomass and calculate a coast-wide index of abundance.\label{fig:ecocons2}](figs/EcoCons_Figure_2.png){width=50% height=50% alt="Survey age-0 abundance through time"}
