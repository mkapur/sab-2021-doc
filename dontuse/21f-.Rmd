### Historical Commercial Landings
The historical commercial catch reconstruction used for this assessment is the same as that used
in the last assessment for Oregon and California (Table 1; Figure 8). A new reconstruction was
available fromWashington that extended the catch history back to 1890. The most recent historical catches (from 1986 to present for Oregon and from 1981 to present for California and Washington)
were extracted from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) during the end of May
2019.
For California, 1916â€“1968 commercial landings rely on estimates from the reconstruction efforts
by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG;
Ralston et al. 2010). Reconstructions utilized spatial information regarding groundfish landings
back to 1931. This method is probably reliable for sablefish because they are identified as a separate
market category. Landings estimates for 1916-1931 were available from published CDFG
Bulletins. Fisheries statistics of the U.S., published by the U.S. Fish Commission, extended the
series back to 1908. Catch from 1908 was estimated to be less than 16 mt and was linearly extrapolated
to zero in the first year of the model. The cumulative catch during this period was relatively
small, and although there is uncertainty in apportionment to gear type, catches were split between
fixed-gear and trawl fleets based on the earliest ratio recorded.
Oregon reconstruction efforts extend historical catches back to 1927 (Karnowski et al., 2014).
Low et al. (1976) provided total landings from 1915-1926. Information prior to 1915 remains
undocumented. Thus, a linear extrapolation from 10 to 0 mt between 1915 and the first year of the
model was applied.
Washington completed a historical catch reconstruction for this 2019 assessment (pers comm.,
Tien-Shui Tsou). These catches represent the best available landed catch information and are
highly similar to the historical catches used in past sablefish stock assessments. The following
information sources were included in the reconstruction:
1. 1890-1908: U.S. Fish Commission bulletin,
2. 1915-1952: PMFC bulletin 3, appendix (page 130, using a conversion factor of 1.75 for
dressed fish),
3. 1953-1969: Washington Statistical bulletin, and
4. 1970-1980: Washington fish ticket database.
Catch area assignments were based on Seattle market reports and Washington Statistical bulletins.
Gear type was based on PMFC bulletin 3 (page 44, Table 2) and Washington Statistical bulletins.
During this reconstruction, it was found that catches during approximately 1935 to 1950 were
slightly higher than those used previously because dressed fish were erroneously treated as whole
fish rather than being expanded using the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW)
conversion factor for that period.
