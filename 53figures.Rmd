![Spatial footprint of  effort using trawl gear (km/km$^2$/yr) in the sablefish fishery before catch shares (2003--2010; left) and post catch shares (2011--2017; right) in comparison to the spatial footprint of the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) Survey (white). Fishery data are from Pacific Fisheries Information Network logbooks and the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program.\label{fig:footprint_twl}](figs/Sablefish_Figures_TWL_lnDens_2views_avg_crop.pdf){width=100% height=100% alt="Spatial Footprint of Trawl Gear"}

![Spatial distribution (gm $\cdot$ ha$^{-1}$) and time series of abundance (mt) for age-0 sablefish recruits from 2003-2018 along the U.S. West Coast. Data are from the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey for 2003-2019 \citep{keller2017} and were analyzed via vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal modeling (\texttt{VAST}) to quantify spatial and temporal patterns in the \fishname\ biomass and calculate a coast-wide index of abundance.\label{fig:ecocons2}](figs/EcoCons_Figure_2.png){width=100% height=100%}

![Sablefish landings from 1890â€“2018 summarized by the gear types included in the base model, fixed-gear and trawl.
