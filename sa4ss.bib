I present a case study involving an overexploited population of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) on the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. This analysis quantifies the risk to the fishery and shows how this decreases as the rate of reduction in total allowble catch increases. The technique helps fishery managers balance biological risk against economic risk. Ways of generalizing the technique are discussed., Une analyse des risques peut améliorer la valeur des conseils scientifiques fournis à des gestionnaires des pêches parce qu'elle exprime l'incertitude propre aux évaluations de stock en termes de risques biologiques. L'auteur présente une étude de cas portant sur une population surexploitée d'hoplostète orange (Hoplostethus atlanticus) peuplant le massif Chatham, en Nouvelle-Zélande. L'analyse quantifie le risque pour la pêche et montre comment il diminue en fonction d'une augmentation du taux de réduction du total des prises allouées. Cette méthode aidera les gestionnaires des pêches à équilibrer le risque biologique et le risque économique. L'auteur examine aussi divers moyens de généraliser cette méthode.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the population structure of Alaskan rockfishes, including Pacific ocean perch (POP, Sebastes alutus), and how persistent and variable oceanographic features may influence their structures. Moreover, early life history information is sparse for many species. We used data from 14 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of young-of-the-year Pacific ocean perch collected during 1998–2003 from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. Broad-scale geographic variation in genetic structure of the young-of-the-year (FST = 0.005, P {\textless} 10−4) had similarities to that observed in a previous adult study. The overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation by distance) was nearly identical to that observed in the adults. Fine-scale geographic divergence was also observed and may be the result of oceanographic circulation features within the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variation (between cohorts) at locations sampled in more than one year is consistent with variable oceanography and fine-scale population structure rather than the influence of a sweepstakes effect. The similarities of the young-of-the-year with the adults and the pattern of genetic divergence confirm that dispersal of Pacific ocean perch is limited in all life stages.},

	abstract = {A major clam fishery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5–3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys.},

Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated.

	abstract = {Theoretical and applied research suggests that survival rates during early life stages will increase when spawning biomass is reduced in marine fishes (termed 'recruitment compensation'). However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally difficult to estimate for individual fish stocks, and its average value for marine fishes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., five biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing efforts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Specifically, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockfish increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textless} 0.6) to 2011 (average: {\textgreater} 0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockfish rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockfishes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly influenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the bias variance tradeoff between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of difficult-to-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-specification of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

This study presents the first bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the California Current and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their first year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species specific when possible.},

Sablefish recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sablefish feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sablefish productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sablefish recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sablefish recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sablefish stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to fishery closures.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatiotemporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from prespawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment., An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources., The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime., In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore., More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a 'common currency' for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and 'design principles' for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves 'species ordination' of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a 'common currency' approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s r (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn’s r tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s r differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn’s r is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn’s r which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of US west coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step towards developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age 1-fish. First, a conceptual life-history approach is used to generate life stage- and spatio-temporally-specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female-spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40-48 °N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (1) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (2) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (3) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (4) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

	abstract = {The petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) is a commercially and ecologically important flatfish found throughout the continental shelf from California through British Columbia, Canada. Although stock assessments are routinely conducted along the West Coast of the United States for this population, these assessments have depended on limited data for estimating reproductive output. In this analysis, the reproductive strategy for this species was revisited, fecundity estimates were updated, and size-d­ependent fecundity relationships were established from fish collected off California and the Pacific Northwest. Results of histological analysis indicate that petrale sole exhibit a determinate batch spawning strategy, with potential annual fecundity (PAF) set prior to the release of eggs over the course of several spawning events. Both PAF and relative PAF (weight-s­ pecific fecundity) increased significantly with maternal length and weight. Regional differences in the strength of the relationship between relative PAF and size indicate that the maternal effect is stronger in the Pacific Northwest; however, more data are necessary to confirm regional patterns. Because reproductive output was not proportionate with female size, fisheries managers should consider using relative PAF in determining the reproductive potential of this stock.},
